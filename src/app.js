import express from 'express';

const app = express();
app.use('/api/v1/student', studentRoutes);

export { app };





if I HAVE A REPO AND THE DEFAULT BRANCH IS main, and I create a branch - learning because I'm learning to code on the job and it's a real world app that will be used by 25,000+ users, if I push to learning , it won't reflect on my contribution graph unless I merget it with main? 




but I created a learning branch in the first place, because I don't want to have unreasonable/unprofessional commits in my main branch , whilst also making sure that my contribution graph shows that I code almost 20 hours and commit at least 5 times a day
